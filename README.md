Hi this is Anweshan Roy Chowdhury (a.k.a @anweshandev).

This is my personl website (hosted on GitHub Pages) is basically a showcase my love of coding, my project, a little info about me etc.

> Intrigued? Visit [my site](https://anweshdev.github.io)

The website structure was taken from [w3schools.com Bootstrap Theme "Company"](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_company.asp). It has then been heavily customized against the current Bootstrap v4 Documentation.

It is nothing fancy, but yet is:

- ðŸ“± responsive
- âš¡blazingly fast
- âœ¨quite modern

<!-- It does feature a contact form, built with [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev) and Javascript. -->
